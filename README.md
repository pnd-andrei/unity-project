uncompleted


One of my Unity projects where I tried to create a forest map with different places to do tasks around.
The missions consist of traveling with a car between two NPCs. At the first NPC, a text was displayed that had to be memorized, and at the second NPC, the player had to say which of the texts was the one he had to memorize initially.
I managed to bring the project almost to the end, but unfortunately it was deleted from my personal computer and all the files are lost.
Several scripts were also written that consist of the movement of the car, the display of texts, different positions of the camera, the interaction between the car and NPCs and so on.
All assets were public and were taken from the Unity Asset Store.
The map was created using Unity Terrain Tools.
I managed somehow to take some screenshots of an old video with the project in it's initial stage:
